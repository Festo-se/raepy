To configure your LSS easily, we recommend you try out the [LSS Config](https://www.robotshop.com/en/lynxmotion-smart-servo-lss-configuration-software.html). More details about it [on the wiki](https://www.robotshop.com/info/wiki/lynxmotion/view/lynxmotion-smart-servo/lss-configuration-software/).

Purchase any LSS model on [RobotShop.com](https://www.robotshop.com/en/lynxmotion-smart-servos.html) and get [accessories](https://www.robotshop.com/en/lynxmotion-servos-accessories-1.html), too!
